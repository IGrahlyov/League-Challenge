# League-Challenge
This was another challenge from Tim Buchalka's Masterclass. The project explores the importance of setting a type parameter. The goal was to create a League from a certain type of sports teams, add some results and print a league table. On top of that, I've added a method for random matches between the teams and an additional condition in the overridden compareTo method.
